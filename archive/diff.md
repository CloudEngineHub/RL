# Documentation Structure Changes

This document compares the documentation structure between the archive/docs directory and the current docs directory, focusing on the reorganization of content across 8 main subdirectories.

## Overview

The documentation has been significantly reorganized from a flat structure in archive/docs to a more hierarchical and organized structure in the current docs directory. The main changes involve:

1. **Reorganization**: Content has been moved from flat directories to nested subdirectories with better categorization
2. **New Structure**: Added new top-level directories and improved navigation
3. **Content Consolidation**: Related content has been grouped together under logical categories
4. **Enhanced Organization**: Added index files and better content hierarchy

## Summary of Major Changes

### 1. **Structural Reorganization**
- **Flat â†’ Hierarchical**: Moved from flat directory structure to organized subdirectories
- **Logical Grouping**: Related content grouped under appropriate categories
- **Navigation Enhancement**: Added index files for better navigation

### 2. **New Top-Level Sections**
- **get-started/**: Installation, setup, and quickstart guides
- **configuration-cli/**: CLI reference and configuration documentation
- **tutorials-examples/**: Tutorials, examples, and use cases
- **advanced/**: Advanced topics, theory, and research
- **about/**: Project overview and architecture information
- **api-docs/**: Comprehensive API documentation

### 3. **Content Consolidation**
- **Training Algorithms**: All algorithm guides moved to `guides/training-algorithms/`
- **Design Documents**: Split into logical categories (core-architecture, data-management, etc.)
- **Development Guides**: Organized into model-development, environment-data, and production-support

### 4. **Enhanced Documentation**
