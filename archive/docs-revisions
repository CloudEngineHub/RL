  - `quickstart.md` - Quick start tutorial
  - `docker.md` - Docker setup
  - `cluster.md` - Cluster setup
  - `local-workstation.md` - Local development

- **`tutorials-examples/`** - Learning resources (1 file + 3 subdirectories)
  - `index.md` - Main tutorials page
  - `tutorials/` - Step-by-step tutorials
  - `examples/` - Working code examples

  - `troubleshooting.md` - Common issues

- **`design-docs/`** - Architecture and design documents (1 file + 4 subdirectories)
  - `index.md` - Main design docs page
  - `core-architecture/` - Core system design
  - `computational-systems/` - Computational design
  - `data-management/` - Data architecture
  - `development-infrastructure/` - Dev infrastructure

### **Visual Design & User Experience**
Successfully implemented modern design features:
- **Grid-based card layout** with professional octicons
- **Color-coded badges** for difficulty levels (Beginner, Advanced, Technical, etc.)
- **Visual hierarchy** with proper spacing and typography
- **Responsive grid layouts** using MyST-Parser grid system
- **Enhanced navigation** with clear learning paths

### **Content Organization**
The documentation now follows a clear multi-level organization:

**Learning Paths:**
- **Beginner Path** (0-2 weeks): Installation → Quickstart → SFT Tutorial → Basic Examples
- **Intermediate Path** (2-4 weeks): DPO Tutorial → Evaluation → Advanced Examples → Use Cases
- **Advanced Path** (4+ weeks): GRPO Tutorial → Performance → Distributed Training → Production

**Content Categories:**
- **Algorithms**: SFT, DPO, GRPO, Evaluation separated into dedicated sections
- **Examples**: End-to-end tutorials and working examples
- **Development**: Model development, testing, debugging workflows
- **Advanced**: Theory, research, performance optimization
- **Reference**: API docs, configuration, CLI reference

### **Technical Improvements**
Successfully implemented enhanced features:
- **AI assistant integration** with custom extensions
- **Enhanced search functionality** with custom extensions
- **JSON output generation** for programmatic access
- **Custom extensions and themes**
- **Better cross-referencing system** with proper metadata

### **Content Quality**
Comprehensive documentation with:
- **Detailed index pages** for each section with proper metadata
- **Consistent formatting** using MyST-Parser markdown
- **Professional documentation standards** with proper frontmatter
- **Better cross-references** and navigation
- **Rich metadata** including difficulty levels, personas, and content types

### **User Experience**
Clear navigation paths implemented:
- **Beginner-friendly "Get Started"** section with progressive learning
- **Clear separation** of content by expertise level
- **Intuitive categorization** with visual cards and badges
- **Structured learning paths** for different user types

### **Documentation Metrics**
**Current State:**
- **168+ files** in organized hierarchy (estimated from directory structure)
- **Rich grid-based navigation** with visual cards
- **Comprehensive metadata** with tags, personas, and difficulty levels
- **Professional theming** with octicons and badges

### **Advanced Features**
Successfully implemented interactive features:
- **AI-powered documentation assistant** with custom extensions
- **Enhanced search** with custom extensions
- **JSON output generation** for programmatic access
- **Content gating** capabilities
- **Responsive design** with modern CSS
- **Professional theming** with custom static assets

## Summary

The documentation transformation has been **successfully completed**, moving from a basic flat structure to a professional, hierarchical documentation site with:

✅ **Complete organizational restructuring** with logical sections  
✅ **Modern visual design** with grid-based cards and professional styling  
✅ **Comprehensive content organization** with clear learning paths  
✅ **Enhanced technical features** including AI assistant and search
