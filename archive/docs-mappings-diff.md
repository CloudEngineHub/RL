## Key Changes Summary

### **Frontmatter Addition**
All markdown files now include standardized frontmatter with:
- **Description**: 1-2 sentence content summary
- **Categories**: Single primary category (e.g., "training-algorithms")
- **Tags**: 2-8 relevant tags for search/discovery
- **Personas**: Target audience (e.g., "mle-focused", "researcher-focused")
- **Difficulty**: beginner/intermediate/advanced/reference
- **Content Type**: tutorial/concept/reference/troubleshooting/example
- **Modality**: text-only/image-only/video-only/multimodal/universal

### **Path Updates**
All internal links updated to reflect new directory structure:
- `../../examples/` â†’ `../../../examples/`
- `../cluster.md` â†’ `../../get-started/cluster.md`
- `../design-docs/` â†’ `../../design-docs/[section]/`

### **Directory Reorganization**
Files moved from flat structure to user-centric organization:
- **Training guides** â†’ `guides/training-algorithms/`
- **Setup files** â†’ `get-started/`
- **Design docs** â†’ organized by topic (`core-architecture/`, `data-management/`, etc.)
- **Examples** â†’ `tutorials-examples/examples/`
- **Use cases** â†’ `tutorials-examples/use-cases/`

### **New Landing Pages**
Added index pages for each major section with:
- Navigation cards and learning paths
- Overview content and key resources
- Logical progression and user workflows

## Developer Review Priorities

### **High Priority (Critical)**
1. **Path Updates** - Verify all internal links work correctly
2. **Frontmatter Accuracy** - Ensure metadata matches content
3. **Navigation Structure** - Check that users can find content
4. **Code Examples** - Verify all code paths and examples work

### **Medium Priority (Important)**
1. **Content Organization** - Ensure logical grouping
2. **Learning Progression** - Verify learning paths make sense
3. **Cross-references** - Check that related content is properly linked
4. **Asset References** - Verify images and other assets load correctly

### **Low Priority (Polish)**
1. **Frontmatter Completeness** - Ensure all metadata is appropriate
2. **Navigation Consistency** - Check for consistent navigation patterns
3. **Content Completeness** - Verify no content was lost in migration
4. **Style Consistency** - Ensure consistent formatting and style
