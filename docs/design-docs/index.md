# Core Design & Architecture

This section contains detailed design documents, architectural decisions, and technical specifications for NeMo RL. These documents provide insights into the framework's internals and design philosophy.

## What You'll Find Here

Our design documents are organized into four main categories to help you understand the framework's architecture and implementation:

### üèóÔ∏è **Core Architecture** 
Explore the fundamental architectural decisions and design principles that shape NeMo RL. Understand the core abstractions, training backends, and parallelization strategies that enable scalable reinforcement learning.

### üìä **Data Management**
Learn about data handling, processing, and persistence mechanisms. Discover how NeMo RL manages different data formats, implements efficient padding strategies, and maintains model state through checkpointing.

### üßÆ **Computational Systems**
Dive into the mathematical foundations and computational components that power NeMo RL. Understand loss function implementations, text generation systems, and observability features.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Development Infrastructure**
Master the development tools and infrastructure that support NeMo RL development. Learn about package management, logging systems, and other development utilities.
