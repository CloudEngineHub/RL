# About NeMo RL Core Design and Architecture

This section contains detailed design documents, architectural decisions, and technical specifications for NeMo RL. These documents provide insights into the framework's internals and design philosophy for advanced users who want to understand, extend, or contribute to the framework.

## What You'll Find Here

Our design documents are organized into four main categories to help you understand the framework's architecture and implementation. These documents are essential for:

- **Understanding the Framework**: Deep dive into how NeMo RL works internally
- **Extending Functionality**: Learn how to add custom algorithms, backends, or environments  
- **Contributing Code**: Understand the codebase structure and design patterns
- **Debugging Issues**: Trace problems through the system architecture
- **Performance Optimization**: Learn about bottlenecks and optimization strategies

### **Design Principles** 
Explore the fundamental architectural decisions and design principles that shape NeMo RL. Understand the core abstractions, training backends, and parallelization strategies that enable scalable reinforcement learning.

### **Data Management**
Learn about data handling, processing, and persistence mechanisms. Discover how NeMo RL manages different data formats, implements efficient padding strategies, and maintains model state through checkpointing.

### **Computational Systems**
Dive into the mathematical foundations and computational components that power NeMo RL. Understand loss function implementations, text generation systems, and observability features.

### **Development Infrastructure**
Master the development tools and infrastructure that support NeMo RL development. Learn about package management, logging systems, and other development utilities.
