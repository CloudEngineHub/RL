# Design Principles

This section contains the fundamental architectural decisions and design principles that shape NeMo RL. These documents provide insights into the core abstractions, training backends, and parallelization strategies that enable scalable reinforcement learning.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Design Philosophy**: Understand the core design principles and philosophical approach behind NeMo RL's architecture
- **FSDP2 Parallel Plan**: Learn about the FSDP2 parallelization strategy and implementation details  
- **Generation**: Explore the text generation pipeline and inference mechanisms
