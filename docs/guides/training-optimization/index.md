# Training Optimization

Welcome to the NeMo RL Training Optimization guide! This section covers essential techniques for optimizing your training process, including learning rate scheduling, training stability, and hyperparameter optimization.

## Overview

Training optimization is crucial for achieving the best performance from your NeMo RL models. This guide covers practical techniques that you can apply immediately to improve your training results.

## Learning Rate Scheduling

Proper learning rate scheduling can dramatically improve training convergence and final model performance. Learn about different scheduling strategies and when to use them.

## Training Stability

Training large language models can be unstable. Learn techniques to maintain training stability and prevent divergence.

## Hyperparameter Optimization

Systematic hyperparameter optimization can help you find the best configuration for your specific use case.

## When to Use Training Optimization

These techniques are essential when:

- **Training is unstable**: Loss oscillates or diverges
- **Convergence is slow**: Training takes too long to converge
- **Performance is poor**: Final model performance is below expectations
- **Hyperparameters are unknown**: You need to find optimal settings

## Key Concepts

### Learning Rate Management
- Dynamic learning rate adjustment
- Warm-up and decay strategies
- Adaptive learning rate methods

### Stability Techniques
- Gradient clipping and normalization
- Loss scaling and monitoring
- Checkpointing and recovery

### Optimization Strategies
- Systematic hyperparameter search
- Multi-objective optimization
- Automated tuning approaches
