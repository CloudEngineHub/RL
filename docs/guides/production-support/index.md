## Production Workflow

### **Development Phase**
1. **Testing**: Use comprehensive testing strategies to validate your training pipelines
2. **Debugging**: Employ debugging techniques to identify and fix issues
3. **Performance Profiling**: Optimize training performance with profiling tools

### **Deployment Phase**
1. **Packaging**: Package your models and training code for deployment
2. **Environment Setup**: Configure production environments and dependencies
3. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring and observability for deployed systems

### **Maintenance Phase**
1. **Troubleshooting**: Resolve issues that arise in production
2. **Updates**: Keep systems updated and secure
3. **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation for your deployments

## Best Practices

### **Testing Best Practices**
- **Unit Testing**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration Testing**: Test component interactions
- **End-to-End Testing**: Test complete training workflows
- **Performance Testing**: Validate performance under load

### **Deployment Best Practices**
