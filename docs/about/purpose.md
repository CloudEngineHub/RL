# Why NeMo RL

NeMo RL was built to address critical challenges in post-training and reinforcement learning for large language models. This page explains the motivation behind NeMo RL and the key problems it solves.

## The Challenge

Training large language models with reinforcement learning presents unique challenges that existing tools don't fully address:

### Scale and Complexity
- **Model Size**: Modern LLMs range from 1B to 70B+ parameters, requiring sophisticated distributed training strategies
- **Resource Management**: Efficiently allocating and managing GPUs across multiple nodes and components
- **Memory Constraints**: Handling large models that don't fit on a single GPU requires advanced parallelism techniques

### Distributed RL Architecture
- **Multiple Components**: RL systems need separate actors for policy training, generation, reward computation, and critics
- **Process Isolation**: Each component may have different dependencies and requirements
- **Coordination**: Synchronizing data flow and state across distributed components
- **Communication**: Efficient data transfer between actors without bottlenecks

### Training Backend Flexibility
- **Diverse Requirements**: Different model sizes and architectures need different backends
- **Framework Lock-in**: Existing tools often force you into a single framework (PyTorch, Megatron, etc.)
- **Migration Complexity**: Moving between backends requires significant code changes

## The Solution

NeMo RL addresses these challenges through a modular, scalable architecture designed specifically for distributed RL with LLMs.

### Unified Distributed Framework

**Ray-Based Orchestration**
- Centralized controller for coordinating all RL actors
- Dynamic resource allocation across single-GPU to multi-node clusters
- Built-in fault tolerance and automatic recovery

**Virtual Cluster Abstraction**
- Unified interface for managing compute resources (GPUs, CPUs, memory)
- Seamless scaling from 1 to 1000+ GPUs
- Works with various cluster managers (Slurm, Kubernetes, bare-metal)

**Worker Groups for Isolation**
- Process isolation for each RL actor (policy, generation, rewards, critics)
- Independent dependency management to avoid conflicts
- Precise resource mapping to hardware

### Multi-Backend Support

NeMo RL provides true backend flexibility without code changes:

| Backend | Use Case | Key Features |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| **DTensor (FSDP2)** | 1-32B models | PyTorch native, memory efficient, easy to use |
| **Megatron-LM** | 32B-70B+ models | Advanced parallelism (TP, PP, SP, CP), long context |
| **Hugging Face** | Broad model support | Wide ecosystem integration, custom architectures |

Switch backends by changing a configuration file - no code rewrite needed.

### Advanced Parallelism Strategies

**FSDP2 (Fully Sharded Data Parallel 2)**
- Next-generation PyTorch distributed training
- Improved memory efficiency over FSDP1
- Automatic sharding and communication optimization

**Tensor Parallelism (TP)**
- Split model layers across GPUs
- Reduces memory per GPU for very large models

**Pipeline Parallelism (PP)**
- Distribute model stages across devices
- Enables training models larger than single-node capacity

**Sequence Parallelism (SP)**
- Parallelize along sequence dimension
- Essential for long context training (16k+ tokens)

**Context Parallelism (CP)**
- Advanced context window distribution
- Enables extremely long sequence processing

### State-of-the-Art Algorithms

**GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)**
- No critic network needed - more memory efficient
- Stable training across diverse model sizes
- Optimized for reasoning tasks (math, code generation)

**DPO (Direct Preference Optimization)**
- Human preference alignment without reward models
- Uses pairwise comparisons from preference datasets
- Simpler and more stable than traditional RLHF

**SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)**
- Initial alignment before RL training
- Prepares models for downstream RL fine-tuning
- Efficient distributed implementation

**Multi-Turn RL**
- Support for sequential decision making
- Enables training for games, tool use, and agentic tasks
- Built-in environment abstractions

### Production-Ready Features

**High-Performance Generation**
- vLLM backend for 3-10x faster inference
- Batched generation across multiple prompts
- Configurable sampling strategies

**Comprehensive Evaluation**
- Built-in evaluation frameworks
- Standardized metrics for reproducibility
- Support for custom evaluation datasets

**Experiment Management**
- WandB and TensorBoard integration
- Comprehensive logging and checkpointing
- Configuration versioning and tracking

**Developer Experience**
- Clean Python API for custom components
- Extensive documentation and examples
- Type hints and comprehensive error messages

## Design Philosophy

NeMo RL follows three core principles:

### 1. Modularity
Every component is designed as a modular abstraction that can be composed and extended. This enables:
- Easy experimentation with different algorithms
- Custom environment development
- Flexible pipeline composition

### 2. Scalability
The architecture scales seamlessly from single GPU to thousands:
- Same code works at any scale
- Automatic resource management
- Efficient communication patterns

### 3. Backend Independence
The framework is backend-agnostic by design:
- Switch backends via configuration
- No vendor lock-in
- Future-proof against framework changes

## Target Users

### Researchers
- Explore cutting-edge RL algorithms with LLMs
- Rapid experimentation and prototyping
- Reproducible research with comprehensive logging

### Machine Learning Engineers
- Deploy scalable training pipelines in production
- Optimize resource utilization across clusters
- Integrate with existing ML infrastructure

### Cluster Administrators
- Manage multi-node training infrastructure
- Monitor resource usage and optimize allocation
- Configure distributed environments

### Data Scientists
- Fine-tune models for specific domains
- Evaluate model performance comprehensively
- Customize training for application needs

## What NeMo RL is NOT

To set clear expectations, NeMo RL explicitly focuses on training and evaluation:

**Not a Deployment/Serving Framework**
- NeMo RL does not provide production inference endpoints
- Use vLLM, TensorRT-LLM, or similar tools for serving
- Model export utilities are provided for deployment handoff

**Not a Data Collection Platform**
- NeMo RL trains on existing datasets
- Data collection and annotation are handled separately
- Dataset interfaces assume pre-existing data

**Not a General RL Library**
- Optimized specifically for LLM post-training
- Not designed for robotics, game playing, or other RL domains
- Focus on text-based policy optimization

## Key Advantages
