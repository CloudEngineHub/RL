# About NeMo RL Development

Welcome to the NeMo RL Development guide! This section covers essential tools and workflows for testing, debugging, profiling, and contributing to NeMo RL.

## Overview

Whether you're contributing to NeMo RL, debugging issues, running tests, or building documentation, this guide provides the workflows and tools you need to be productive.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Testing**: Run unit tests, functional tests, and track performance metrics
- **Debugging**: Debug distributed Ray applications with the Ray Distributed Debugger
- **Building Documentation**: Build, develop, and contribute to NeMo RL documentation
- **GPU Profiling**: Profile GPU performance with Nsys
- **FP8 Quantization**: Enable FP8 quantization for efficient training
- **Custom vLLM**: Experiment with custom vLLM implementations

## Development Best Practices

### Set Up Your Environment

Before starting development work:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/RL.git
   cd RL
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   uv sync --all-extras --all-groups
   ```

3. **Run tests to verify setup**:

   ```bash
   uv run --group test bash tests/run_unit.sh
   ```

### Development Cycle

A typical development workflow:

1. **Write code** with appropriate tests
2. **Run tests locally** to verify functionality
3. **Debug issues** using the Ray debugger if needed
4. **Build documentation** if adding new features
5. **Submit PR** with tests and docs
