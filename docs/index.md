# NeMo RL Documentation

Welcome to the NeMo RL documentation. NeMo RL is an open-source, comprehensive framework for reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning of large language models.

## What is NeMo RL

NeMo RL is a production-ready framework that combines the power of reinforcement learning with large language models. It provides a unified platform for training, fine-tuning, and deploying language models using state-of-the-art RL algorithms like DPO, GRPO, and SFT.
