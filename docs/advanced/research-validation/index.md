# Research and Validation

This section covers how to design rigorous experiments, evaluate model performance, and ensure reproducible research. Build robust evaluation frameworks and maintain scientific rigor in your RL research.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Experimental Design**: Design controlled experiments and research studies
- **Model Evaluation**: Build comprehensive evaluation frameworks
- **Reproducible Research**: Ensure reproducible results and scientific rigor
