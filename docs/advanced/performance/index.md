## Key Performance Areas

### Memory Optimization
NeMo RL provides advanced memory optimization techniques:

- **Gradient Checkpointing**: Reduce memory usage by recomputing intermediate activations
- **Mixed Precision Training**: Use lower precision to reduce memory and speed up training
- **Model Sharding**: Distribute model across multiple GPUs
- **Memory Profiling**: Monitor and optimize memory usage patterns

### Distributed Training
Scale training across multiple devices:

- **Communication Optimization**: Efficient gradient compression and overlap
- **Load Balancing**: Dynamic batching and workload distribution
- **Sharding Strategies**: Choose appropriate model sharding approaches
- **Network Optimization**: Optimize inter-node communication

### Performance Monitoring
Comprehensive monitoring and profiling:

- **Real-Time Metrics**: Monitor training speed, memory usage, and throughput
- **Profiling Tools**: Use PyTorch profiler for detailed performance analysis
- **Benchmarking**: Compare performance across different configurations
- **Alerting**: Set up alerts for performance issues

## Performance Optimization Workflow

### 1. Baseline Measurement
- Profile current training performance
- Identify bottlenecks and memory issues
- Establish performance baselines

### 2. Memory Optimization
- Enable gradient checkpointing for large models
- Use mixed precision training
- Optimize data loading and preprocessing

### 3. Distributed Training
- Scale training across multiple GPUs
- Optimize communication patterns
- Balance workload across nodes

### 4. Continuous Monitoring
- Monitor key performance metrics
- Set up performance alerts
- Regularly profile and optimize

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Simple
- Begin with basic optimizations
- Profile before optimizing
- Measure impact of each change

### 2. Memory First
- Optimize memory usage before speed
- Use gradient checkpointing for large models
- Enable mixed precision training

### 3. Data Loading
- Use multiple workers for data loading
- Enable pin memory for GPU transfers
- Prefetch data when possible

### 4. Distributed Training
- Use appropriate sharding strategy
- Overlap communication with computation
- Balance load across nodes

### 5. Monitoring
- Monitor key metrics continuously
- Set up alerts for performance issues
- Use profiling tools regularly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Performance Issues

1. **Memory Issues**
   - Reduce batch size
   - Enable gradient checkpointing
