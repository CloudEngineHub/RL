# About Advanced Topics

Essential advanced topics for AI developers and scientists: algorithm development, performance scaling, research validation, and production deployment.

## What You'll Find Here

Our advanced topics are organized into four core areas that cover the essential needs of AI developers and scientists:

### **Algorithm Development**
Extend and customize NeMo RL algorithms for your specific use cases. Implement custom DPO and GRPO variants, design novel loss functions, and understand mathematical foundations.

### **Performance and Scaling**
Scale NeMo RL from single GPU to production clusters. Optimize memory usage, implement distributed training, and achieve maximum performance for large-scale models.

### **Research and Validation**
Design rigorous experiments, evaluate model performance, and ensure reproducible research. Build robust evaluation frameworks and maintain scientific rigor.

### **Production Deployment**
Deploy NeMo RL models in production environments. Build serving systems, implement monitoring, and ensure reliable model deployment.

## Key Capabilities

- **Custom Algorithms**: Extend and customize RL algorithms
- **Scale Training**: Train models on large clusters efficiently
- **Research Rigor**: Conduct reproducible research experiments
- **Deploy Models**: Build production-ready serving systems
