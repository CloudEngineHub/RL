# About NeMo RL Advanced Topics

Welcome to NeMo RL Advanced Topics! This section provides the technical depth you need to extend, optimize, validate, and deploy NeMo RL for real-world applications.

## What You'll Find Here

Our advanced topics are organized into four core areas that cover the essential needs of AI developers and scientists:

### **Algorithm Customization**
Extend and customize NeMo RL algorithms for your specific use cases. Implement custom DPO and GRPO variants, design novel loss functions, and adapt algorithms for new domains.

### **Performance and Scaling**
Scale NeMo RL from single GPU to production clusters. Optimize memory usage, implement distributed training, and achieve maximum performance for large-scale models.

### **Research and Validation**
Design rigorous experiments, evaluate model performance, and ensure reproducible research. Build robust evaluation frameworks and maintain scientific rigor.

### **Production Deployment**
Deploy NeMo RL models to production with reliable serving architectures, comprehensive monitoring, and production-ready infrastructure.

## Navigation Guide

Some topics have similar names but different focuses:

- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: 
  - [Training](../training/hyperparameter-optimization.md) - Practical optimization techniques
  - [Research](../research/hyperparameter-optimization.md) - Research methodology and experimental design
- **Custom Loss Functions**:
  - [Training](../training/custom-loss-functions.md) - Training-specific loss functions
  - [Algorithm Customization](../algorithm-customization/custom-loss-functions.md) - Domain-specific and novel loss functions
- **Experimental Design**:
  - [Research](../research/experimental-design.md) - Research methodology and statistical analysis
  - [Research Validation](../research-validation/experimental-design.md) - Validation frameworks and reproducibility
- **Monitoring**:
  - [Performance](../performance/monitoring.md) - Training performance monitoring
  - [Production](../production-deployment/monitoring-alerting.md) - Production deployment monitoring

## When to Use Advanced Topics

These topics are for developers and scientists who need to:

- **Extend NeMo RL**: Implement custom algorithms and loss functions
- **Scale to Production**: Optimize performance and deploy at scale
- **Validate Research**: Design rigorous experiments and ensure reproducibility
- **Deploy Models**: Build production-ready serving systems
