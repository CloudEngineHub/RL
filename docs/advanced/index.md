## When to Use Advanced Topics

These topics are for developers who need to:

- **Extend NeMo RL**: Implement custom algorithms and loss functions
- **Scale to Production**: Optimize performance and deploy at scale
- **Customize Behavior**: Modify framework behavior for specific use cases
- **Validate Models**: Create robust evaluation and comparison frameworks
- **Deploy Models**: Build production-ready serving systems

## Learning Path

1. **Start with Guides**: Master basic usage patterns first
2. **Identify Extension Needs**: Determine what customizations you need
3. **Implement Gradually**: Start with small extensions, then scale
4. **Validate Thoroughly**: Use proper evaluation frameworks
5. **Deploy Carefully**: Follow production deployment best practices

## Key Concepts

### Framework Extension
- Custom algorithm implementations
- Loss function design patterns
- Performance optimization techniques
- Production deployment strategies

### Customization Patterns
- Extending base classes
