# About NeMo RL Advanced Topics

Welcome to the NeMo RL Advanced Topics section! This collection provides essential technical content for AI developers and scientists who need to extend, optimize, validate, and deploy NeMo RL for real-world applications.

## What You'll Find Here

Our advanced topics are organized into four core areas that cover the essential needs of AI developers and scientists:

### **Algorithm Customization**
Extend and customize NeMo RL algorithms for your specific use cases. Implement custom DPO and GRPO variants, design novel loss functions, and adapt algorithms for new domains.

### **Performance & Scaling**
Scale NeMo RL from single GPU to production clusters. Optimize memory usage, implement distributed training, and achieve maximum performance for large-scale models.

### **Research & Validation**
Design rigorous experiments, evaluate model performance, and ensure reproducible research. Build robust evaluation frameworks and maintain scientific rigor.

### **Production Deployment**
Deploy NeMo RL models to production with reliable serving architectures, comprehensive monitoring, and production-ready infrastructure.
