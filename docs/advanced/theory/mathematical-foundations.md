# Mathematical Foundations

This document provides the core mathematical foundations that underpin all NeMo RL algorithms. Understanding these concepts is essential for AI scientists and researchers working with reinforcement learning for language models.

## Policy Gradient Methods

### Basic Policy Gradient Theorem

The policy gradient theorem forms the foundation of all policy-based reinforcement learning methods used in NeMo RL:

$$\nabla_\theta J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi_\theta} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{T} \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a_t|s_t) \cdot R(\tau) \right]$$

where:
- $J(\theta)$ is the objective function (expected return)
- $\pi_\theta$ is the policy parameterized by $\theta$
- $\tau = (s_0, a_0, r_0, s_1, a_1, r_1, \ldots)$ is a trajectory
- $R(\tau)$ is the return of trajectory $\tau$

### Advantage Function

The advantage function measures how much better an action is compared to the average action in a given state:

$$A^\pi(s, a) = Q^\pi(s, a) - V^\pi(s)$$

where:
- $Q^\pi(s, a)$ is the state-action value function
- $V^\pi(s)$ is the state value function

### Policy Gradient with Advantage

Using the advantage function, the policy gradient becomes:

$$\nabla_\theta J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi_\theta} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{T} \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a_t|s_t) \cdot A^\pi(s_t, a_t) \right]$$

This formulation reduces variance compared to using raw returns.

## KL Divergence Control

### KL Divergence

The KL divergence between two policies measures how different they are:

$$D_{KL}(\pi_\theta || \pi_{\theta_{old}}) = \mathbb{E}_{s \sim \pi_{\theta_{old}}} \left[ \mathbb{E}_{a \sim \pi_{\theta_{old}}} \left[ \log \frac{\pi_{\theta_{old}}(a|s)}{\pi_\theta(a|s)} \right] \right]$$

### Schulman Approximation

NeMo RL uses the Schulman approximation for KL divergence computation:

$$D_{KL}(\pi_\theta || \pi_{\theta_{old}}) \approx \mathbb{E}_{s \sim \pi_{\theta_{old}}} \left[ \mathbb{E}_{a \sim \pi_{\theta_{old}}} \left[ \frac{\pi_\theta(a|s)}{\pi_{\theta_{old}}(a|s)} - \log \frac{\pi_\theta(a|s)}{\pi_{\theta_{old}}(a|s)} - 1 \right] \right]$$

This approximation is unbiased and guaranteed to be positive.

## Convergence Theory

### Policy Gradient Convergence

Under certain conditions, policy gradient methods converge to a local optimum:

**Theorem**: If the policy is differentiable and the advantage function is bounded, then policy gradient methods converge to a local optimum of the expected return.

**Proof Sketch**:
1. The policy gradient is an unbiased estimate of the true gradient
2. Under appropriate learning rate schedules, the algorithm converges
3. The convergence rate depends on the policy class and advantage estimation

### KL Divergence Bounds

For stable training, we need to bound the KL divergence between consecutive policies:

**Lemma**: If $D_{KL}(\pi_\theta || \pi_{\theta_{old}}) \leq \delta$, then the policy update is stable.

This bound prevents excessive policy updates that could destabilize training.

## Importance Sampling

### Basic Importance Sampling

When using off-policy data, importance sampling corrects for the distribution mismatch:

$$\mathbb{E}_{x \sim p(x)}[f(x)] = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim q(x)}\left[\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}f(x)\right]$$

where $p(x)$ is the target distribution and $q(x)$ is the sampling distribution.

### Importance Weights in NeMo RL

NeMo RL uses importance weights to correct for off-policy data:

$$w_t = \frac{\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{old}}(a_t|s_t)}$$

These weights are used in loss function computations to ensure unbiased gradient estimates.

## Numerical Stability

### Log-Space Computations

To avoid numerical underflow, NeMo RL performs computations in log-space:

$$\log \pi_\theta(a|s) = \log \text{softmax}(f_\theta(s))_a$$

### Gradient Clipping

To prevent gradient explosion, gradients are clipped:

$$\text{clip}(\nabla_\theta, \text{max_norm}) = \nabla_\theta \cdot \min\left(1, \frac{\text{max_norm}}{\|\nabla_\theta\|_2}\right)$$

## Implementation Considerations

### Floating-Point Precision

NeMo RL casts logits to float32 before computing losses to ensure numerical stability:

```python
next_token_logits = next_token_logits.to(torch.float32)
```

### Masked Computations

To handle variable-length sequences, masked computations are used:

$$\text{masked_mean}(x, \text{mask}) = \frac{\sum_i x_i \cdot \text{mask}_i}{\sum_i \text{mask}_i}$$

### Distributed Reductions

For distributed training, metrics are reduced across ranks:

$$\text{global_metric} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \text{local_metric}_i$$

## Theoretical Guarantees

### Monotonic Improvement

Under certain conditions, NeMo RL algorithms provide monotonic improvement guarantees:

**Theorem**: If the KL divergence is bounded and the advantage function is accurate, then the expected return increases monotonically.

### Sample Complexity

The sample complexity depends on:
- Policy class complexity
- Advantage estimation accuracy
- KL divergence bounds
- Learning rate schedule

## Research Applications

These mathematical foundations enable:

1. **Algorithm Development**: Understanding theory for custom algorithm design
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Mathematical guidance for parameter selection
3. **Performance Analysis**: Theoretical bounds for expected performance
4. **Reproducibility**: Mathematical framework for reproducible experiments
